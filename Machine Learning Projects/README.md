# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! Here, you'll discover a diverse collection of projects that I've undertaken throughout my academic journey, covering both my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. In addition to projects developed during my coursework, I've also included implementations learned from various online platforms, with a special focus on YouTube tutorials.

## Project Highlights

Explore a range of machine learning applications, including:

- **[Project 1 Diabetes Prediction]:** This project focuses on predicting diabetes based on the analysis of the PIMA Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using relevant health-related features.

- **[Project 2: E-mail Spam Prediction]:** This project aims to predict whether an email is spam or not based on various email attributes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model classifies emails as spam or non-spam using features extracted from the email content.

## Learning Sources

Some projects in this repository are the result of learning from online platforms (with a particular emphasis on YouTube tutorials) and some are from my graduation. Each project folder contains relevant code to help you understand and replicate the work.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt these projects to your needs. 
Happy coding!
