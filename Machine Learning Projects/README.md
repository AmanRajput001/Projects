# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! Here, you'll discover a diverse collection of projects that I've undertaken throughout my academic journey, covering both my undergraduate and postgraduate studies. In addition to projects developed during my coursework, I've also included implementations learned from various online platforms, with a special focus on YouTube tutorials.

## Project Highlights

Explore a range of machine learning applications, including:

- **[Project 1 Diabetes Prediction]:** This project focuses on predicting diabetes based on the analysis of the PIMA Diabetes Dataset. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can effectively predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using relevant health-related features.

## Learning Sources

Some projects in this repository are the result of learning from online platforms, with a particular emphasis on YouTube tutorials. Each project folder contains relevant documentation and code to help you understand and replicate the work.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt these projects to your needs. 
Happy coding!
